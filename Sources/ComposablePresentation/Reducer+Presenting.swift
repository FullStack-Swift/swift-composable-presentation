  /// - All effects returned by the local reducer will be canceled when `LocalState` becomes `nil`.
  /// - Inspired by [Reducer.presents function](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/blob/9ec4b71e5a84f448dedb063a21673e4696ce135f/Sources/ComposableArchitecture/Reducer.swift#L549-L572) from `iso` branch of `swift-composable-architecture` repository.

  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - localReducer: A reducer that works on `LocalState`, `LocalAction`, `LocalEnvironment`.
  ///   - toLocalState: `ReducerPresentingToLocalState` that can get/set `LocalState` inside `State`.
  ///   - toLocalAction: A case path that can extract/embed `LocalAction` from `Action`.
  ///   - toLocalEnvironment: A function that transforms `Environment` into `LocalEnvironment`.
  ///   - onPresent: An action run when `LocalState` is set to an honest value. Defaults to an empty action.
  ///   - onDismiss: An action run when `LocalState` becomes `nil`. Defaults to an empty action.
  ///   - breakpointOnNil: If `true`, raises `SIGTRAP` signal when an action is sent to the reducer
  ///       but state is `nil`. This is generally considered a logic error, as a child reducer cannot
  ///       process a child action for unavailable child state. Default value is `true`.
  /// - Returns: A single, combined reducer.
